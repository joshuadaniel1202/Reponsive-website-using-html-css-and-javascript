        <p class="large">Knowledge is necessary for success</p>
        <p class="small">Knowledge can be produced in many different ways. The most important source of empirical knowledge is
            perception, which is the usage of the senses. Many theorists also include introspection as a source of
            knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of one's own mental states. Other sources often discussed
            include memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. According to foundationalism, some of these
            sources are basic in the sense that they can justify beliefs without depending on other mental states. This
            claim is rejected by coherentists, who contend that a sufficient degree of coherence among all the mental
            states of the believer is necessary for knowledge. According to infinitism, an infinite chain of beliefs is needed.

        <p class="large">Let us learn together</p>
        <p class="small">Collaborative learning is very important in achieving critical thinking.According to Gokhale (1995), 
            individuals are able to achieve higher levels of learning distinct from, cooperative learning. While both models 
            use a division of labor, collaborative learning requires the mutual engagement of all participants and a coordinated
             effort to solve the problem whereas cooperative learning requires individuals to take responsibility for a specific
              section and then coordinate their respective parts together. Another proposed differentiation is that cooperative 
              learning is typically used for children because it is used to understand the foundations of knowledge while collaborative
               learning applies to college and university students because it is used to teach non-foundations of learning. Another believed
                difference is that collaborative learning is a philosophy of interaction whereas cooperative learning is a structure of interaction.
